Create a file called Dockerfile

Inside put in:
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

==== just some notes ====

Build the docker image with the command:
docker build -t html-server-image:v1 .

Run the command to let the image run on port 80:
docker run -d -p 80:80 html-server-image:v1

Create an index.html file

If the container is running it can now be viewed in localhost:80 from the browser.
